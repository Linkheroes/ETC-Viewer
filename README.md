# ETC-Viewver

This application lets you view your mining statistics on the Ethereum Classic token using your Nanopool account.

You can also see how many workers are online and how much they have mined. You can also see the number of ETCs confirmed or not, the ETC price and the minimum amount before making a transfer from the mining pool to your Wallet, represented by a Progress bar. Finally, you can view your ETC payments in your Wallet.
