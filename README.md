# ETC-Viewver

This application lets you view your mining statistics on the Ethereum Classic token using your Nanopool account.

You can also see how many workers are online and how much they have mined. You can also see the number of ETCs confirmed or not, the ETC price and the minimum amount before making a transfer from the mining pool to your Wallet, represented by a Progress bar. Finally, you can view your ETC payments in your Wallet.

## How does it work?

Simply enter the Wallet address in the text field and the application will load all the information it finds via the Nanopool api. However, you'll need to mine on their mining pool and not another one !

Here is the address of an ETC wallet

The application has been translated into French from the official English version.

This project was carried out to learn how to use an external API.
